<p id= "school">I'm a passionate individual with a background in Creative Technologies from the University of Colorado Boulder. With a strong foundation in design, both web and graphic, I've honed my creative skills through diverse professional experiences. Beyond the confines of the design world, you'll often find me exploring the great outdoors or working on personal crafting projects. Taking time to get outside has instilled in me a deep appreciation for creativity, design, and the beauty of the world around us.
